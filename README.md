# YT Short Clipper v2

A Windows desktop app that turns a long-form YouTube video into ready-to-post 9:16
short-form clips — picking the highlights with an LLM, reframing to portrait, and burning
in word-by-word captions.

**Stack:** React 19 + TypeScript + Vite · Tauri v2 (Rust shell) · Python sidecar (yt-dlp,
FFmpeg, MediaPipe)

> **Windows only.** The build scripts are PowerShell, the app ships as a portable zip with
> a WebView2 bootstrapper, and caption/hook rendering reads fonts from `C:\Windows\Fonts`.
> Nothing is macOS/Linux-ready today.

> **Status: beta.** Expect rough edges and breaking changes between releases.

## What it does

1. You paste a YouTube URL and upload your own `cookies.txt` (see
   [YouTube cookies](#youtube-cookies)).
2. yt-dlp fetches the video and its original subtitle track.
3. An LLM reads the transcript and proposes highlight segments (58–120s by default).
4. Each segment is cut, reframed to 9:16, captioned, and written out as an MP4.
5. Optionally, clips are uploaded and scheduled through [Repliz](https://api.repliz.com).

## Features

- **AI highlight detection** from the video's subtitle transcript, via any
  OpenAI-compatible endpoint
- **AI direction** per video — free-text steering: name a time range, chase a recurring
  topic, or rule material out
- **Output language** for titles and hook text, defaulting to the video's own language
- **Portrait reframe** in three modes: face tracking (MediaPipe), centered on black bars,
  or centered on a blurred fill — the centered modes are dramatically faster since they
  skip per-frame face detection
- **Word-by-word captions** burned from YouTube's original subtitle track — no
  transcription API and no local Whisper model required
- Optional **hook text overlays** and logo/credit watermarks
- **Direct upload** to the Repliz social media platform

### AI providers

A single provider is configured once in **AI Models** and shared by highlight detection
and title generation. Anything OpenAI-compatible works; the app ships presets for OpenAI,
Google Gemini, Groq, ApiSmart, the maintainer's own YTClip AI gateway, and a
Custom/Local option for vLLM, Ollama, or similar. Your API key is stored in the app's
local data directory — it is never committed and never sent anywhere except the provider
you configured.

### AI direction

Left empty, the model picks clips on its own. Filled in, the direction outranks the
built-in selection principles:

- An explicit clock range (`2:00 - 2:50`) is used **exactly** — that clip is exempt from
  the usual 58–120s duration filter, and the run samples at a lower temperature so the
  instruction is actually followed.
- Array order is clip order, so "clip pertama dari …" lands first in the list.
- Anything the direction rules out is left out.

Custom system messages (in **AI Models**) can place the direction with a
`{user_direction}` placeholder; without it the direction is appended at the end.

## YouTube cookies

The app needs cookies from a logged-in YouTube session for yt-dlp to fetch subtitles and
video. You supply your own — nothing is bundled.

1. Open YouTube in your browser and make sure you are logged in.
2. Install the **Get cookies.txt LOCALLY** extension.
3. Run it while on `youtube.com` and export `cookies.txt`.
4. In the app, click **Upload YouTube cookies to continue** and pick that file.

Notes:

- Don't log out of YouTube after exporting — that invalidates the cookies.
- Frequent 403s mean the cookies went stale; export a fresh file.
- A valid export contains `SID`, `HSID`, `SSID`, `APISID`, `SAPISID`, and `LOGIN_INFO`.
- `cookies.txt` grants access to your Google account. It is gitignored here, stored only
  in the app's local data directory, and passed to yt-dlp on your machine — but treat the
  file itself like a password and never share it.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) latest stable
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.13+
- Windows 10/11 with PowerShell

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Install Node dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install Python dependencies
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Download runtime binaries (FFmpeg, Deno)
#    Existing files are skipped — add -Force to actually re-download them.
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/fetch-deps.ps1

# 4. Build the Python sidecar executable
npm run build:sidecar
```

FFmpeg must be a **GnuTLS** build (the fetch script pulls one from gyan.dev). Schannel
builds hang forever on the byte-range requests used for section downloads.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Start Vite dev server
npm run tauri dev    # Start Tauri dev window
```

> **Python changes need a sidecar rebuild.** `src-tauri/binaries/ytclip-sidecar-*.exe`
> takes precedence over the dev Python module, so edits under `yt_short_clipper_core/`
> do nothing until you run `npm run build:sidecar` — the app keeps running the frozen
> copy without complaining. Delete that binary to fall back to
> `py -m yt_short_clipper_core.sidecar` for fast iteration. Frontend and Rust changes
> hot-reload as usual.

### Updating yt-dlp

```bash
py -m pip install --upgrade yt-dlp   # 1. upgrade the package
                                     # 2. bump the floor in requirements.txt
npm run build:sidecar                # 3. re-freeze it into the sidecar
```

Check the yt-dlp changelog for a raised **Deno** floor while you are there (2026.06.09
raised it to v2.3.0). Deno drives `remote_components` for YouTube's JS challenges, so an
under-floor binary breaks extraction quietly — and `fetch-deps.ps1` will not replace an
existing `deno.exe` without `-Force`.

## Release Build

```bash
# One command: sidecar → frontend → Tauri build → assemble portable zips
npm run release
```

This produces two zips in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`:

- `YTShortClipperV2_<version>_x64_portable.zip` — full bundle for new users
- `YTShortClipperV2_<version>_x64_update.zip` — app + sidecar only, for existing users

See [BUILD_GUIDE.md](BUILD_GUIDE.md) for the full release flow, version bumping
(4 files), and the build-only-what-changed shortcuts.

## Network calls & telemetry

Being transparent about every host the app talks to, since some of it is the maintainer's
own backend rather than a third party:

| Endpoint | When | What is sent |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube / `googlevideo` (via yt-dlp) | Fetching video + subtitles | Your YouTube cookies |
| Your configured AI provider | Highlight + title generation | Subtitle transcript, your prompt, your API key |
| `api.ytclip.org/webhook/yt-clipper/latest-version` | On launch | Random installation ID, app version |
| `api.ytclip.org/webhook/yt-clipper/notification` | On launch | Random installation ID, app version |
| `api.ytclip.org/webhook/yt-clipper/menu` | On launch | Random installation ID, app version |
| `api.ytclip.org/webhook/yt-clipper/success-log` | After a clip renders | Random installation ID, app version, clip duration, reframe mode |
| `api.ytclip.org/webhook/yt-clipper/presigned-url` + `api.repliz.com` | Only if you use Repliz upload | Filename, the video file, your Repliz keys |

No video content, transcript, or account identity is sent to `api.ytclip.org`. The
installation ID is a random value generated locally, not tied to any account. If you fork
this, point these at your own backend or strip them out — see
[`src/hooks/`](src/hooks/).

### Sidebar links

The external links at the bottom of the sidebar are served by
`api.ytclip.org/webhook/yt-clipper/menu`, so they can change without an app release.
The four page routes above them stay hardcoded.

Icons are named by the API as kebab-case strings and resolved through the allowlist in
[`src/config/menuIcons.ts`](src/config/menuIcons.ts) — an icon must exist there before
the server can use it. Responses are validated (https-only URLs, capped count and label
length, bad entries dropped individually), cached, and fall back to
`DEFAULT_MENU_ITEMS` in [`src/hooks/menu.ts`](src/hooks/menu.ts) when offline.
